			<h5> The foundation of every pizza is the crust, and good crust comes from good dough. You might be surprised to learn that pizza dough is made from nothing more than flour, water, yeast, olive oil, salt, and sometimes sugar. Start by adding your yeast packet to a cup of warm water. Let the yeast activate, and then add two cups of flour, two tablespoons of olive oil, two teaspoons of sugar, and a teaspoon of salt.</h5>

				<label><input type="radio" name="questionOne" value="1" onclick="oneQuestionA();" checked/> In 1918 pizza began to rise in popularity in the United States.</label>

				<label><input type="radio" name="questionOne" value="2" onclick="oneQuestionB();"/> Mix all of that together and wait half an hour for the dough to rise. </label>

			<h4> <u> Question #2 </u> </h4>
			<h5> Pizza is so old that its origins are not quite clear to historians, but the word pizza comes from the Latin verb pinsere, meaning to press. It may also be related to the Greek word pitta. In any event the word “pizza” was first documented in Italy in 997 AD. Whatever they were eating back then, however, was quite different from the pizza that we know today. Pizza as we know it could not really have been invented until sometime during the 16th century, when tomatoes were brought to Europe from America.

			<p>
				<label><input type="radio" name="questionTwo" value="one" onclick="twoQuestion();" checked> Pizza is made with dough, sauce, and cheese. These elements are crucial to the construction of the food. </label>
				<label><input type="radio" name="questionTwo" value="two" onclick="twoQuestion();"> One of the greatest development in the history of pizza occurred in 1905, when pizza was first sold in America. </label>
