## Mary Babin Final Project MSTU 5003

Description: Within this repository there is a reflection video on the process of the page, the demonstration that has the project, and my Github Account. The project is an extension of the first Student Page. Within this page, I tried to keep the aesthetics relatively the same in order to not confuse students, if they were to complete this work. There are some similarities in terms of the code, but also many differences. By using feedback from Professor Kuwata, I was able to make some of the elements of my previous project better, and I also added new elements as well. (Some changes are discussed within the reflection video).
